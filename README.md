## Installation

If you wish to use this Theme, download the DiscordElectro.theme.css file and import it to your Discord Themes Folder.
This theme won't get any support unless I myself decide to update or fix it. Issues will be fixed aslong as I use it.

1 - Download ![BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases) and Install it.

2 - After installing it, download the ![DiscordDarkness.theme.css](https://github.com/LyGhT1337/Discord-Electro/releases/download/2.2.0/DiscordElectro.theme.css) file and put it in your Themes Folder.


The plugins are purely preference. You can download them and put them into the plugins folder of BetterDiscord in order to use them.
They include stuff like:

 - ColorSighted; Which changes the Status colors to the actual non color-blind colors.
 - CopyRawMessage; Name explains it.
 - GameActivityToggle; Adds a toggle for this options to your Mute / Settings Bar.
 - ThemeSettings; Adds Settings for your theme.
 - VoiceUserCounter; Adds a User count to voice channels.
